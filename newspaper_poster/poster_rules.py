POSTER_RULES = """POSTER RULES:

SUGGESTED CONTENT TO DEPICT (HIGH PRIORITY)
Whenever it fits the story and composition, strongly prefer including:

- A central HUMAN FIGURE as the focal point (waist-up or full-body), a generic person representing the main actor implied by the story (citizen/worker/official/doctor/athlete/student/researcher/etc.). If the story actor is unclear, use a neutral “everyday person.”
- A BUILDING or PLACE from the summary as a background silhouette (courthouse/city hall/hospital/factory/stadium/school/office tower/neighborhood/skyline/etc.). If the setting is unclear, use a generic civic building or skyline.
- 2–3 KEY OBJECTS/SYMBOLS drawn from the summary that best represent the story (documents, gavel, chart, microphone, vehicle, medical icon, protest sign, handshake, microchip, money, etc.). If the summary lacks concrete objects, use generic symbols like a document + chart + megaphone.

"PUBLIC FIGURES & LIKENESS\n"
"* PUBLIC FIGURES OK: If the story’s main actor is an adult public figure, you MAY depict that person in a stylized/illustrative manner; this improves recognizability and keeps the poster faithful to the source.\n"
"* STYLIZATION IS MANDATORY: All depictions must strictly follow the chosen artistic stylization and avoid photorealistic replication to remain purely artistic.\n"
"* If the main actor is not a public figure or is unclear, use a generic 'everyday person' archetype.\n"
